  abstract = {Machine and deep learning algorithms have increasingly been applied to solve problems in various areas of knowledge. Among these areas, Chemometrics has been benefited from the application of these algorithms in spectral data analysis. Commonly, algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Partial Least Squares are applied to spectral datasets to perform classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we present a 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) to evaluate the effectiveness on spectral data obtained from spectroscopy. In most cases, the spectrum signals are noisy and present overlap among classes. Firstly, we perform extensive experiments including 1D-CNN compared to machine learning algorithms and standard algorithms used in Chemometrics on spectral data classification for the most known datasets available in the literature. Next, spectral samples of the SARS-COV2 virus, which causes the COVID-19, have recently been collected via spectroscopy was used as a case study. Experimental results indicate superior performance of 1D-CNN over machine learning algorithms and standard algorithms, obtaining an average accuracy of 96.5\%, specificity of 98\%, and sensitivity of 94\%. The promissing obtained results indicate the feasibility to use 1D-CNN in automated systems to diagnose COVID-19 and other viral diseases in the future.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an empirical analysis of theperformance of popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for identifying objects in real time video feeds. The most popular convolution neural networks for object detection and object category classification from images are Alex Nets, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50. A variety of image data sets are available to test the performance of different types of CNN’s. The commonly found benchmark datasets for evaluating the performance of a convolutional neural network are anImageNet dataset, and CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and MNIST image data sets. This study focuses on analyzing the performance of three popular networks: Alex Net, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50. We have taken three most popular data sets ImageNet, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 for our study, since, testing the performance of a network on a single data set does not reveal its true capability and limitations. It must be noted that videos are not used as a training dataset, they are used as testing datasets. Our analysis shows that GoogLeNet and ResNet50 are able to recognize objects with better precision compared to Alex Net. Moreover, theperformance of trained CNN’s vary substantially across different categories of objects and we, therefore, will discuss the possible reasons for this.},

  abstract = {The effect of sample movement on spectral response during fiber probe diffuse reflectance near-infrared spectrometry (NIR) sampling was characterized. This is of central importance in Process Analytical Chemistry (PAC) and Process Analytical Technology (PAT). The incitement to this study was the observation of spectral artifacts during measurements of powder samples in process streams when using a mechanically scanning spectrometer. Artifacts appeared as momentary changes in the spectral response during acquisition of a scan. These transitions emanate from continuous replacement of the sample subfraction seen by the probe and are typical for turbid media where sample properties may vary locally with respect to scattering and/or absorption. The impact on qualitative and quantitative analysis using chemometric methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression was evaluated through experimental and theoretical simulations. It was generally found that spectra with the smallest residuals after projection onto the models came from non-moving samples or samples moving only slowly. It is shown that the magnitude of the spectral residuals is directly connected to the effective sample size, which relates both to sample speed as well as to the sample area presented to the probe. Implications for in-line/on-line process analysis of solids are discussed.},

  abstract = {Cell culture media (CCM) used in industrial biotechnology are complex mixtures of molecules and elements that are inherently difficult to analyze comprehensively. CCM quality analysis is of utmost importance for efficient production of protein-based therapeutics with the correct Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs). Here we discuss the use of rapid spectroscopic methods for routine screening of CCM molecular variance which include electronic (UV–vis absorption and fluorescence) and vibrational (Raman, FT-IR, and Near-Infra-red) spectroscopies. CCM analysis needs to provide: identity testing, compositional variance analysis (i.e. lot-to-lot variation), validation of media preparation protocols, and correlations with Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) or product CQAs. Rapid spectroscopic methods can fulfil some of these requirements but only with correct sample handling and preparation. Accurate analysis requires the use of chemometrics combined with a detailed knowledge of sample behavior such as water absorption and chemical stability.}

This review provides an overview of major critical source and control options of contaminants. The critical source of contamination is suddenly or deliberately introduction of contaminants on the desired system during the beginning up to ending of laboratory work. To overcome the challenge numerous strategies must be daily exercised such as obtaining pure and viable cells from reputable gene banks; checking the characteristics of the culture periodically, and practicing good aseptic technique, and using antibiotics routinely. In general, this paper suggested that possible to reduce or eliminate contamination frequency and seriousness by visual inspection of the culture within a few days of it becoming infected.},

  abstract = {Full waveform inversion is a method used to recover subsurface parameters, and it requires heavy computational resources. We present a cyclic shot subsampling method to make the full waveform inversion efficient while maintaining the quality of the inversion results. The cyclic method subsamples the shots at a regular interval and changes the shot subset at each iteration step. Using this method, we can suppress the aliasing noise present in regular-interval subsampling. We compared the cyclic method with divide-and-conquer, random, and random-in-each-subgroup subsampling methods using the Laplace-domain full waveform inversion. We found examples of a 2D marine field data set from the Gulf of Mexico and a 3D synthetic salt velocity model. In the inversion examples using the subsampling methods, we could reduce the computation time and obtain results comparable to that without a subsampling technique. The cyclic method and two random subsampling methods yielded similar results; however, the cyclic method generated the best results, especially when the number of shot subsamples was small, as expected. We also examined the effect of subsample updating frequency. The updating frequency does not have a significant effect on the results when the number of subsamples is large. In contrast, frequent subsample updating becomes important when the number of subsamples is small. The random-in-each-subgroup scheme showed the best results if we did not update the subsamples frequently, while the cyclic method suffers from aliasing. The results suggested that the cyclic subsampling scheme can be an alternative to the random schemes and the distributed subsampling schemes with a frequently changing subset are better than lumped subsampling schemes.},

To correlate the collected spectra with °Brix, pH and biomass, different multivariate data methodologies were applied. Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS) and locally weighted regression (LWR) were used to assess the relationship between FT-NIR spectra and the abovementioned process parameters that define the beer fermentation. The accuracy and robustness of the obtained results clearly show the suitability of FT-NIR spectroscopy, combined with multivariate data analysis, to be used as a quality control tool in the beer fermentation process. FT-NIR spectroscopy, when combined with LWR, demonstrates to be a perfectly suitable quantitative method to be implemented in the production of beer.},

  abstract = {Anoectochilus roxburghii (Wall.) Lindl. (Orchidaceae) is a rare traditional Chinese medicine. For seeking high profit, some traditional Chinese medicine sellers usually adulterated A. roxburghii with Goodyera Schlechtendaliana and Ludisia discolor or directly fake A. roxburghii using Anoectochilus formosanus. These counterfeits with similar appearance greatly influence the prescription efficacy. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an effective and fast authentication method to identify A. roxburghii and its counterfeits. In this paper, the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data of A. roxburghii and its counterfeits are mearsured. Then, an improved inception architecture based 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (Improved 1D-Inception-CNN) is designed for processing the NIRS data and identifying A. roxburghii and its counterfeits. The Improved 1D-Inception-CNN has less parameters and high calculation efficiency which makes the identification model more practical. The experimental results show that compared with traditional structured CNN models, the complexity of the Improved 1D-Inception-CNN is reduced by 40 \%, the parameters are reduced by 50 \% and the performances are improved by 1.01 \%. Therefore, the Improved 1D-Inception-CNN model based on NIRS technology can effectively and quickly identify A. roxburghii and its counterfeits.},

  abstract = {Preprocessing of near-infrared (NIR) spectra is an essential part of multivariate calibration. It mainly aims to remove artefacts caused during measurement to improve prediction performance or interpretation. However, preprocessing can have undesired side-effects. Additionally, calibration algorithms can learn to deal with artefacts by themselves when enough samples are available. This may influence the effect preprocessing has on prediction performance when the calibration dataset size increases. In this paper we investigate the interaction between the size of the calibration data and preprocessing for NIR calibrations for several datasets. Results show that extending the calibration data with more samples improves prediction performance, regardless of the preprocessing strategy. Although prediction performance almost always benefits from preprocessing, extending the calibration data can reduce the effect of preprocessing on prediction performance. This means the optimal preprocessing strategy may change as a function of the number of samples. It is demonstrated that using a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach to determine the optimal preprocessing strategy leads to equal or better prediction performance for all calibration set sizes compared to the case of not preprocessing at all. Preprocessing is most valuable for small calibration sets, but as the calibration set increases can become obsolete or even harmful. Therefore, we recommend to always evaluate the effect of a preprocessing strategy before making or updating calibration models.},

The comparison shows their characteristics via applying them to analyze Hydrochlorothiazide (HCZ) and Benazepril hydrochloride (BZ) in presence of HCZ impurities; Chlorothiazide (CT) and Salamide (DSA) as a case study. The analysis results prove to be valid for analysis of the two active ingredients in raw materials and pharmaceutical dosage form through handling UV spectral data in range (220–350nm). For proper analysis a 4 factor 4 level experimental design was established resulting in a training set consisting of 16 mixtures containing different ratios of interfering species. An independent test set consisting of 8 mixtures was used to validate the prediction ability of the suggested models. The results presented indicate the ability of mentioned multivariate calibration models to analyze HCZ and BZ in presence of HCZ impurities CT and DSA with high selectivity and accuracy of mean percentage recoveries of (101.01±0.80) and (100.01±0.87) for HCZ and BZ respectively using PLSR model and of (99.78±0.80) and (99.85±1.08) for HCZ and BZ respectively using SVR model. The analysis results of the dosage form were statistically compared to the reference HPLC method with no significant differences regarding accuracy and precision. SVR model gives more accurate results compared to PLSR model and show high generalization ability, however, PLSR still keeps the advantage of being fast to optimize and implement.},

Samples taken from a three-day fibroblast culture were analyzed with standard clinical chemistry techniques and with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The data were analyzed in three phases in an attempt to solve problems of correlation in the data. First, partial least-squares regression was used to build a multivariate calibration model based on the near-infrared spectra of the cell culture media and measured reference values. Second, an independent calibration was performed with aqueous mixtures of glucose, lactate, ammonia, glutamate, and glutamine. Finally, a calibration using a combination of spectra from cell culture media samples and aqueous mixtures was performed. In each case, the spectral loadings obtained from the calibration were inspected to determine the extent of weighting given to different spectral regions. The results indicate that a selective calibration model can be produced by combining data from samples of different type. Prediction errors of 2, 8, and 15\% were obtained for glucose, lactate, and ammonia, respectively.},

The features of these materials change as they age, leading to changes in their spectra. The ageing process often occurs only slowly, i.e., corresponding reflection spectra can be analyzed each hour or at an even longer interval. This paper undertakes the problem of analyzing surfaces of non-stable, rapidly changing materials such as waxes or adhesive materials. To obtain their characteristic spectra, NIR spectroscopy using a Digital Light Projection (DLP) spectrometer was used. Based on earlier experiences and the current state of the art, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were used to process spectral sequences to proceed with an enormous value of spectra gathered during measurements.},

Its characteristics and application potential differs from infrared (IR) or Raman spectroscopy. This vibrational spectroscopy technique elucidates molecular information from the examined sample by measuring absorption bands resulting from overtones and combination excitations. Recent decades brought significant progress in the instrumentation (e.g., miniaturized spectrometers) and spectral analysis methods (e.g., spectral image processing and analysis, quantum chemical calculation of NIR spectra), which made notable impact on its applicability. This review aims to present NIR spectroscopy as a matured technique, yet with great potential for further advances in several directions throughout broadly understood bio-applications.

  abstract = {Spectrum preprocessing is an essential component in the near-infrared (NIR) calibration. However, it has mostly been configured arbitrarily in the literature and calibration applications. In this paper, a systematic evaluation framework was proposed to quantify the effect of preprocessing, where repeated cross-validation and evaluation are involved. As many as 108 preprocessing schemes were gathered from the literature and were tested on 26 different NIR calibration problems. Using the evaluation framework, appropriate schemes can be found for several datasets, reducing the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) by 50\%–60\% compared with using the raw spectrum. However, the influence of preprocessing is highly data-dependent, and no universal solution could be found. Taking the effectiveness and correlation into consideration, Savitzky-Golay (SG), SG1D, and SG1D + vector normalization (VN)(/standard normal variate [SNV]) are worth testing first. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity at both the dataset level and sample level demonstrated the necessity of a complete evaluation.

It is difficult to accurately sort and process them by appearance during harvest and transportation. Conventional chemical detection means are time-consuming and costly, which greatly affects the cost and efficiency of Fishery production. Therefore, there is an urgent need for smart Fisheries methods which use for the classification of mixed fish. In this paper, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to assess salmon and cod samples. This study aims to evaluate feasibility of a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying different species of fishes by the corresponding spectra in comparison to traditional chemometrics Partial Least Squares. After comparing the effects of different batch sizes, number of convolutional kernels, number of convolutional layers, and number of pooling layers on the classification of NIRS spectra comparing different structures of one-dimensional (1D)–CNN, we propose the 1D-CNN-8 model that is most suitable for the classification of mixed fish. Compared with the results of traditional chemometrics methods and BPNN, the prediction model of the 1D-CNN model can reach 98.00\% Accuracy and the parameters are significantly better than others. Meanwhile, the parameters and floating-point operations of the optimal model are both small. Therefore, the improved CNN model based on the NIRS can effectively and quickly identify different kinds of fish samples and contribute to realizing edge computing at the same time.},

  abstract = {To improve the yield of industrial fermentation, herein, we report a method based on Fourier-transform near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) to predict the growth of yeast. First, the spectra were obtained using an FT-NIR spectrometer during the process of yeast cultivation. Each spectrum was acquired over the range from 10 000 to 4000 cm−1, which resulted in spectra with 1557 variables. Moreover, the optical density (OD) value of each fermentation sample was determined via photoelectric turbidity method. Then, using a method based on competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), characteristic wavelength variables were selected from the preprocessed spectral data. Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) algorithm was employed to develop the prediction model for the determination of OD. The results of the model based on GMR were achieved as follows: only 13 characteristic wavelength variables were selected by CRAS, the coefficient of determination Rp2 was 0.98842, and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.07262 in the validation set. Finally, compared to kernel partial least squares regression (KPLS), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme learning machine (ELM) models, GMR model showed excellent performance for prediction and generalization. This study demonstrated that FT-NIR spectroscopy analysis technology integrated with appropriate chemometric approaches could be utilized to monitor the growth process of yeast, and GMR revealed its superiority in model calibration.},

  abstract = {The Part 1 prequel to this review evaluated the evolution of modelling techniques used in evaluation of fruit quality over the past three decades and noted a progression towards the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this review, Part 2, the use of CNNs for NIR fruit quality evaluation is explored, given the success of CNNs in various other fields, such as image, video, speech, and audio processing, and the availability of large (open source) datasets of fruit spectra and reference quality attribute, which is required for the training of CNN models. The review provides an overview of deep learning and the CNN architectures and techniques used in NIR spectroscopy for regression modelling, with advantages and disadvantages identified. Studies using CNN for NIR based fruit quality evaluation are then critically examined. Eight publications have presented on models using the same open-source mango dry matter calibration and test set, enabling inter-method comparisons. CNN models have been demonstrated to be accurate, precise and robust. Techniques of transfer learning for CNN models offer an alternative solution to model updating and calibration transfer methods applied in traditional chemometrics. The review has highlighted crucial areas that require resolution and exploration in this application through future research, including, (i) data requirements for training a CNN (ii) optimal spectral pre-processing for CNN (iii) CNN architecture and hyper-parameter selection and tuning for fruit quality evaluation (iv) CNN model interpretability and explainability. Future studies must conduct clearer comparison to partial least squares (PLS) regression and shallow ANNs to better assess the prospective benefit of using CNN, a more complex model. The potential for visualisation of spectra relevance to the CNN model using techniques such as GradCam, currently employed in visualising 2D-CNN models, remains to be explored.},

  abstract = {Aims The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the influence of physical movement on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data, (2) to establish a video-NIRS system which simultaneously records NIRS data and the subject's movement, and (3) to measure the oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentration change (Δoxy-Hb) during a word fluency (WF) task. Experiment 1 In 5 healthy volunteers, we measured the oxy-Hb and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) concentrations during 11 kinds of facial, head, and extremity movements. The probes were set in the bilateral frontal regions. The deoxy-Hb concentration was increased in 85\% of the measurements. Experiment 2 Using a pillow on the backrest of the chair, we established the video-NIRS system with data acquisition and video capture software. One hundred and seventy-six elderly people performed the WF task. The deoxy-Hb concentration was decreased in 167 subjects (95\%). Experiment 3 Using the video-NIRS system, we measured the Δoxy-Hb, and compared it with the results of the WF task. Δoxy-Hb was significantly correlated with the number of words. Conclusion Like the blood oxygen level-dependent imaging effect in functional MRI, the deoxy-Hb concentration will decrease if the data correctly reflect the change in neural activity. The video-NIRS system might be useful to collect NIRS data by recording the waveforms and the subject's appearance simultaneously.},

Speech control has become an important type; Our project worked on designing a word-tracking model by applying speech recognition features with deep convolutional neuro-learning. Six control words are used (start, stop, forward, backward, right, left). Words from people of different ages. Two equal parts, men and women, contribute to our speech dataset which is used to train and test proposed deep neural networks. Collect data in different places in the street, park, laboratory and market. Words ranged in length from 1 to 1.30 seconds for thirty people. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied as advanced deep neural networks to classify each word from our pooled data set as a multi-class classification task. The proposed deep neural network returned 97.06\% as word classification accuracy with a completely unknown speech sample. CNN is used to train and test our data. Our work has been distinguished from many other papers that often use ready-made and fairly consistent data of the isolated word type. While our data are collected in different noisy environments under different conditions and from two types of speech, isolated word and continuous word.},

  abstract = {Infrared spectroscopy (wavelengths ranging from 750–25,000 nm) offers a rapid means of assessing the chemical composition of a wide range of sample types, both for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Its use in the food industry has increased significantly over the past five decades and it is now an accepted analytical technique for the routine analysis of certain analytes. Furthermore, it is commonly used for routine screening and quality control purposes in numerous industry settings, albeit not typically for the analysis of bioactive compounds. Using the Scopus database, a systematic search of literature of the five years between 2016 and 2020 identified 45 studies using near-infrared and 17 studies using mid-infrared spectroscopy for the quantification of bioactive compounds in food products. The most common bioactive compounds assessed were polyphenols, anthocyanins, carotenoids and ascorbic acid. Numerous factors affect the accuracy of the developed model, including the analyte class and concentration, matrix type, instrument geometry, wavelength selection and spectral processing/pre-processing methods. Additionally, only a few studies were validated on independently sourced samples. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate some promise of infrared spectroscopy for the rapid estimation of a wide range of bioactive compounds in food matrices.},

  abstract = {Plant science uses increasing amounts of phenotypic data to unravel the complex interactions between biological systems and their variable environments. Originally, phenotyping approaches were limited by manual, often destructive operations, causing large errors. Plant imaging emerged as a viable alternative allowing non-invasive and automated data acquisition. Several procedures based on image analysis were developed to monitor leaf growth as a major phenotyping target. However, in most proposals, a time-consuming parameterization of the analysis pipeline is required to handle variable conditions between images, particularly in the field due to unstable light and interferences with soil surface or weeds. To cope with these difficulties, we developed a low-cost, 2D imaging method, hereafter called PYM. The method is based on plant leaf ability to absorb blue light while reflecting infrared wavelengths. PYM consists of a Raspberry Pi computer equipped with an infrared camera and a blue filter and is associated with scripts that compute projected leaf area. This new method was tested on diverse species placed in contrasting conditions. Application to field conditions was evaluated on lettuces grown under photovoltaic panels. The objective was to look for possible acclimation of leaf expansion under photovoltaic panels to optimise the use of solar radiation per unit soil area.},

  abstract = {Recently, deep learning methods, for example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved high performance in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. The limited training samples of HSI images make it hard to use deep learning methods with many layers and a large number of convolutional kernels as in large scale imagery tasks, and CNN-based methods usually need long training time. In this paper, we present a wide sliding window and subsampling network (WSWS Net) for HSI classification. It is based on layers of transform kernels with sliding windows and subsampling (WSWS). It can be extended in the wide direction to learn both spatial and spectral features more efficiently. The learned features are subsampled to reduce computational loads and to reduce memorization. Thus, layers of WSWS can learn higher level spatial and spectral features efficiently, and the proposed network can be trained easily by only computing linear weights with least squares. The experimental results show that the WSWS Net achieves excellent performance with different hyperspectral remotes sensing datasets compared with other shallow and deep learning methods. The effects of ratio of training samples, the sizes of image patches, and the visualization of features in WSWS layers are presented.},

  abstract = {Fungi are the cause of more than a billion infections in humans every year, although their interactions with the host are still neglected compared to bacteria. Major systemic fungal infections are very unusual in the healthy population, due to the long history of coevolution with the human host. Humans are routinely exposed to environmental fungi and can host a commensal mycobiota, which is increasingly considered as a key player in health and disease. Here, we review the current knowledge on host-fungi coevolution and the factors that regulate their interaction. On one hand, fungi have learned to survive and inhabit the host organisms as a natural ecosystem, on the other hand, the host immune system finely tunes the response toward fungi. In turn, recognition of fungi as commensals or pathogens regulates the host immune balance in health and disease. In the human gut ecosystem, yeasts provide a fingerprint of the transient microbiota. Their status as passengers or colonizers is related to the integrity of the gut barrier and the risk of multiple disorders. Thus, the study of this less known component of the microbiota could unravel the rules of the transition from passengers to colonizers and invaders, as well as their dependence on the innate component of the host's immune response.

  abstract = {Quality identification of multi-component mixtures is essential for production process control. Artificial sensory evaluation is a conventional quality evaluation method of multi-component mixture, which is easily affected by human subjective factors, and its results are inaccurate and unstable. This study developed a near-infrared (NIR) spectral characteristic extraction method based on a three-dimensional analysis space and establishes a high-accuracy qualitative identification model. First, the Norris derivative filtering algorithm was used in the pre-processing of the NIR spectrum to obtain a smooth main absorption peak. Then, the third-order tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA) algorithm was used for characteristic extraction, which effectively reduced the dimensionality of the raw NIR spectral data. Finally, on this basis, a qualitative identification model based on support vector machines (SVM) was constructed, and the classification accuracy reached 98.94\%. Therefore, it is possible to develop a non-destructive, rapid qualitative detection system based on NIR spectroscopy to mine the subtle differences between classes and to use low-dimensional characteristic wavebands to detect the quality of complex multi-component mixtures. This method can be a key component of automatic quality control in the production of multi-component products.},
